              <h3>Android</h3>
              <p>I have about 1 year of experience creating functioning Android app in a college environment.
                    I Worked primarily using java in Android Studio as the main programing Langue/IDE 
                    creating about 18 different applications, during this time period we covered a wide range of topic such as
                    Managing Activities, Fragments, Managing Scrollable Lists, Concurrency and Thread Communication,
                    Making HTTP Connection, XML/JSON Parsing, Firebase and Data Storage, Local Data Storage, Google Maps,
                    Google places API, Google APIs and Location Services
                  </p>

              <h3>Java</h3>
              <p>I have about 2 years of experience creating Java application in a college environment.
                    I started off my college experience with Java using Eclipse as my primary IDE as 
                    This was my introduction to problem-solving using a high-level modern programming language I learned about
                    source and object code, elements of a programming language, numbering systems assignment, 
                    arithmetic, logical, and relational operations; data types; expressions, variables, constants, 
                    and literals, naming conventions; reserved words, program flow, arrays,
                    object-oriented concepts such as (classes, objects, and methods) and problem-solving techniques.
                    Next, I transitioned to using NetBeans for the more advanced topic in Java these topics include version control, 
                    use of debuggers, class design, aggregation and association, exception handling, generic and abstract types, 
                    inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes. This naturally progressed to using IntelliJ and study 
                    the theory and implementation of abstract data types including  stacks, queues, and both general purpose and 
                    specialized trees and graphs.  Includes the implementation and analysis of algorithms related to the 
                    various data structures studied, including creation, searching, and traversal of ADTs.

              <h3>Python</h3>
              <p>I have about 4 months of experience Using Python. primarily using PyCharm and Visual Studio Code. I learned the basic of python 
                  by completing a project called beautiful soup. With this library in python, I created an API call to indeed. Using the web scraper, a parsed
                  through the returned HTML for the relevant information. Using this information, I then used flask to launch a virtual website and displayed the 
                  returned job information onto a rudimentary website.

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>It has been a long journey, but I have found what I am meant to-do, I started my college
                life at a Local community college in my Hometown. I soon realized if I wanted to make something 
                of myself I would have to move out of my hometown as it was a small town with mostly textile plants for work and this is not 
                what i wanted to do. My life was about to change
            </p>
            <p>One day in the campus library I was working on my final project about Net-Neutrality when I received an email that would change the 
                direction my life would take. This email was from an Army National guard recruiter. I knew that I wanted to go to a 4-year college but had no means to
                pay for it. So, when I received this email and called the recruiter and he told me that if I joined the National guard they would help pay for my schooling
                As you might have guessed I put my college life on pause and joined the Army National guard. After 8 year of service and one deployment overseas in IRAQ I applied to 
                UNC Charlotte while overseas. about 3 months later I received a call from home with the good news. I had been accepted to UNC Charlotte. Upon returning from deployment
                I packed up all my belonging and Moved to Charlotte to begin my education in the field of computer science.
